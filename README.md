# society-at-the-peak

## What is this?

This is a collaboration between RadiatorofWind and FatherOfLies. Poindexter and STTP are Discord bots, while a website dashboard will be in the works.

## What does "Society at the Peak" (STTP) mean?

There is no meaning to the name "Society at the Peak." I (Radiator) named the acronym weird on accident (it should be SATP.) The name of the project will reflect this later on, and the name itself may be overhauled at any time.

## Cool, so who is this for?

No one right now; we are making it for ourselves as practice. If we discover this later on when we are more experienced we may cringe on this later, but this is a learning experience.

## Sweet. What else is planned?

We aren't sure after the website. Both bots intend to use Discord's brand new slash commands, though after that it could be anything.
