# society-at-the-peak

## What is this?

This is a collaboration between RadiatorofWind and FatherOfLies. Poindexter and STTP are Discord bots, while a website dashboard will be in the works.

## What does "Society at the Peak" (STTP) mean?

There is no meaning to the name "Society at the Peak." I (Radiator) named the acronym weird on accident (it should be SATP.) The name of the project will reflect this later on, and the name itself may be overhauled at any time.

## Cool, so who is this for?

No one right now; we are making it for ourselves as practice. If we discover this later on when we are more experienced we may cringe on this later, but this is a learning experience.

## Sweet. What else is planned?

We aren't sure after the website. Both bots intend to use Discord's brand new slash commands, though after that it could be anything.

## Yo I can add things here?

Right adding on to Radiator's answers, I was thinking we could perhaps make it into a real app that you could download... that would be cool... Also STTP might adapt a more civilized and classy personality due to the fact that it is supposed to represent the peak abilities of our society. Also this project right now is to fuel Radiator and my ego. We are currently listening to music that helps that.
